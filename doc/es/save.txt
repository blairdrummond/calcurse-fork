Save calcurse data.

Data are split into four different files which contain :

         / ~/.calcurse/conf -> user configuration
        |                      (layout, color, general options)
        |  ~/.calcurse/apts -> data related to the appointments
        |  ~/.calcurse/todo -> data related to the todo list
         \ ~/.calcurse/keys -> user-defined key bindings

In the config menu, you can choose to save the calcurse data automatically
before quitting.
