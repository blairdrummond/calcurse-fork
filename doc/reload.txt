Reload
======

Reload appointments and todo items.

When there are unsaved modifications, calcurse asks you whether you want to
discard the modifications, keep the local modifications (and cancel the reload
action) or merge the modifications with the content of the data files. The
merge operation launches an external merge tool (defaults to vimdiff(1), can be
changed by setting the 'MERGETOOL' environment variable).
