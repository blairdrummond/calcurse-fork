Jump to a specific day in the calendar.

Using this command, you do not need to travel to that day using the
displacement keys inside the calendar panel.

If you hit [ENTER] without specifying any date, calcurse checks the system
current date and you will be taken to that date.

Notice that you can also specify a global key binding to return to the current
day, no matter which panel is currently selected.
