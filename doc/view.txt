View the item you select in either the todo or appointment panel.

This is useful when an event description is longer than the available space to
display it. If that is the case, the description will be shortened and its end
replaced by '...'. To be able to read the entire description, just run the view
command and a popup window will appear, containing the whole event.

Press any key to close the popup window and go back to the main calcurse
screen.
