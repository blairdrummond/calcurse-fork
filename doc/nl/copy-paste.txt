Copy and Paste
==============

Copy and paste the currently selected item. This is useful to quickly copy an
item from one date to another. To do so, one must first highlight the item that
needs to be copied, then press the key assigned to the copy function. Once the
new date is chosen in the calendar, the appointment panel must be selected and
the paste key must be pressed to paste the item. The item will appear in the
appointment panel, assigned to the newly selected date.
